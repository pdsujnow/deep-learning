\section{Conclusion}\label{sec.conclusion}

In this term project, we studied technologies of Deep Learning and applied them to Twitter sentiment classification. Our CNN with word embedding, with a minimalist network structure, achieves an average accuracy of 79.60\% on Stanford Twitter Sentiment corpus. Compared to the state-of-art result of 86.8\%, it shows the potential of CNN for Twitter, or social media in general, sentiment classification. Our RNN gives 81.7\% accuracy for movie reviews but only 54.6\% accuracy on the same Twitter dataset. This suggests that RNN may not be as well-suited for social media sentiment classification as CNN.
